I like this history and piping business: 
  457  history | tail -20 > how-i-produced-figure-3.txt
you can get the above line by typing !457
  465  cut
  466  cut -d , -f 1-2 animals.txt 
  467  history | tail -3 >> Notes 
uniq only removes adjacent duplicated lines. so to remove all duplicated lines, sort data first
uniq -c does counts for each line
